### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you ðŸ™‚

Freelance web developer, I do several activities depending on the demand:

<strong ðŸ’ª> I create websites (Html, Css, Sass, Bootstrap, React, javascript) or with a cms with WordPress (elementor). I have fun creating features for my clients like a search and find (https://chaplin16.github.io/Search-Find-Viviane/) and on code pen also for fun (https://codepen.io/your-work/).

<strong ðŸ’ª> I'm occasionally subcontracting for overworked developers (front-end, image optimization, database update...).

<strong ðŸ’ª> I give courses in computer science on the basics of development in html and css.

âž• Focus on google performance (loading speed, referencing, accessibility, hierarchy)

âž• Backend notions, cms migrations.

âž• Reactive, serious, good mood
